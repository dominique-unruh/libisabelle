# libisabelle

A Scala library which talks to Isabelle.
It currently works with most recent Isabelle versions (there are two tiers of support).

## Including libisabelle into your project

`libisabelle` is cross-built for Scala 2.11.x and 2.12.x.
Drop the following lines into your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "info.hupel" %% "libisabelle" % version,
  "info.hupel" %% "libisabelle-setup" % version
)
```

With this configuration, the automatic Isabelle setup will fetch additional JAR dependencies from Maven Central or Sonatype, depending on the selected Isabelle version.
If you don't want this, additionally include the following dependency:

```scala
  "info.hupel" %% "pide-package" % version
```

This adds PIDE implementations for all supported Isabelle versions to your classpath.


## Support tiers

There is a "full" and a "generic" tier.
Isabelle versions that are supported generically are only supported on Linux and macOS and do not offer full features, i.e. starting a system.
It only requires a `bin/isabelle` executable to be present.

Usually, more versions get added to the full tier.
Sometimes, breaking changes in Isabelle require that full support needs to be dropped.

| libisabelle version | full support versions   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0.9.2 â€“ 0.9.3       | 2016, 2016-1, 2017      |
| 1.0.0 (upcoming)    | 2017, 2018 (upcoming)   |


## Using the plugin

There is an [sbt plugin](https://github.com/larsrh/sbt-libisabelle/) for working with Isabelle sources available.
Refer to its README for more information.
You should use the plugin if your build contains Isabelle source files.


## Command line interface

`libisabelle` features a CLI called `isabellectl`.
Currently, it only allows some basic features like downloading, building and launching Isabelle.
You can download a CLI executable from [GitHub](https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle/raw/master/bin/isabellectl).


### Downloading & checking your installation

```
isabellectl check
```


### Launching Isabelle/jEdit

```
isabellectl -s HOL-Probability jedit
```


### Using Isabelle tools

```
isabellectl exec getenv ISABELLE_HOME
```
